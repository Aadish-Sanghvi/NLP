<h2> TF-IDF vs Gensim </h2>

1️⃣ TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

✅ Best for: Traditional NLP tasks like document retrieval, keyword extraction, and text classification.

✅ Pros:

* Simple and interpretable.

* Works well for small to medium datasets.

* Good for feature engineering in ML models.

🚫 Cons:

* Doesn't capture word meaning or context.

* Sparse and high-dimensional.

2️⃣ Gensim (Word2Vec, FastText, etc.)

✅ Best for: Deep NLP tasks like word similarity, sentiment analysis, and contextual embeddings.

✅ Pros:

* Captures semantic relationships between words.

* Can handle large datasets efficiently.

* Word embeddings can be reused in deep learning models.

🚫 Cons:

* Requires more computational power.

* Not directly interpretable like TF-IDF.
